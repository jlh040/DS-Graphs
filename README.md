# Graphs Exercise

- This repository contains my solution to Springboard exercise 47.10.12.
- In this exercise, I was tasked with implementing methods on a graph class.
  - Some of the methods include:
    - Returning an array of nodes visited using DFS (recursion).
    - Returning an array of nodes visited using BFS.
    - Removing an edge between two vertices.
- Check out ***graph.js*** to see all of the instance methods that I created for the class.

## Testing

- First run:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

- Then run:

  ```bash
  jest graph.test.js
  ```
